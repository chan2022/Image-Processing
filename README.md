# Image-Processing
Implemented methods using HSV color space, Histogram, Computing distance between histograms and 1-Nearest Neighbor concepts.   
I designed and programmed this algorithm by using Python, numpy and openCV.

First method is to convert BGR image to HSV image.
The second and third methods are using to HSV images that were generated by the first method to select yellow and green hues.
such as,

to, <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101159967/159134505-d0a8769f-33bb-4676-bc2c-d87b085be953.png">

The third method takes in an HSV image that was created by the first method, and generates a 1-dimensional histogram and normalize it.
The fourth method implements the L1 and L2 distnace functions where it calculates the sum of the absolute differences of corresponding elements for L1 
and for L2 it calculates the square root of the sum fo the squared differences of corresponding elements.

These third and fourth methods are used on the fifth method, 1-nearest neighbor algorithm, where it takes in a list of image file names as one parameter
and with the first element being the key image, select the image that matches the key image the most using the second parameter as calculation method of 
either L1 or L2. 

Therefore, as a result,
